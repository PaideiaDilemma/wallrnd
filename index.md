This project aims to provide a utility for generating random abstract wallpapers.

It is only intended for **generating** the images (SVG), not actually setting them as a wallpaper.

A bash script to automatically change wallpaper is provided, and has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa).
Portability of this script is outside of the scope of this project (the image generator however should be portable to any OS), but scripts that work for other shells/distros are welcome.
